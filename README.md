This Interactive Quiz App is a simple and user-friendly web-based quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app begins with a login page, where users enter their names before starting the quiz. Once the user provides their name, the quiz interface appears with a clean and modern design. The structure is divided into two main sections — the login container and the quiz container — both styled with CSS for an appealing visual experience. The overall layout uses a centered, responsive design with smooth gradients and rounded corners to ensure it looks attractive on both desktop and mobile screens.
The core quiz functionality is handled through JavaScript. A predefined array (quizData) stores questions, options, and correct answers. When the quiz starts, JavaScript dynamically displays each question and its corresponding options. When a user selects an answer, all options are disabled, and the correct and incorrect ones are highlighted with different colors for immediate feedback. The app also keeps track of the user’s score, updates it upon each correct answer, and moves to the next question when the "Next" button is clicked.
Finally, once all questions are answered, the app displays a completion message showing the user’s total score and provides an option to restart the quiz. The restart feature resets all progress and takes the user back to the login page to try again. Overall, this project demonstrates a practical use of event handling, DOM manipulation, and user interaction in JavaScript — making it an excellent example of how to create an engaging and interactive learning tool for web users.This interactive quiz app effectively combines simplicity and functionality to enhance user engagement. It provides an intuitive experience where users can easily navigate from login to quiz completion.
The real-time feedback on answers, score tracking, and personalized greeting using the user’s name make the quiz feel interactive and rewarding. Designed with clean visuals and smooth transitions, the app not only tests knowledge but also demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create dynamic web applications that are both educational and enjoyable to use.
